# Western9Hackathon

Krish from the future here, wanted to add a couple of notes for this project:

- client is hosted on firebase
- server is hosted on railway. Our trial runs out on about May 25th. We can't use vercel because this is repo lives in a team for which we need to pay for vercel.
- to save time, I added all env variables to the repo, but I know that's not a good practice. Consequently I have made this repo private for now.
