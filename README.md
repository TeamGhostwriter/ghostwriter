# Western9 Hackathon

Ever looked at the likes of Jcole, Kendrick Lamar, or Drake and wondered how you could become the next hip-hop sensation?

Here's where Ghostwriter comes in to help you learn how to freestyle.

Start rapping from one of our pre-saved beats and record your self into a mic. Through Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text technology, we take the words you rap and find words that rhyme with it through the Rhymezone API to spark ideas for your next line.

Want to hear your freestyles and share them? You can save your recorded freestyles on to our instance of CockroachDB and share them with other users.
